# Conspiracy Theory Generator

Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/9dhfni/i_made_a_spreadsheet_that_lets_you_create_your/) Reddit post, this script generates conspiracy theories according to the template.

I just wanted to see if I could write this in 30 minutes. I did.

## Installation and Usage

To use this, clone the directory and run the python script from any shell using ```./con-gen.py```
It won't work without Python 3 installed, you may need to run ```sudo apt-get python3``` or other distro appropriate command.
